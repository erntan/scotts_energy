# What's Wrong with Phoenix Roads?
Intersections are known to be the most dangerous places for drivers and pedestrians alike (Sources needed). Not only do they cause road congestion and lead to negative driving experiences, they are expensive to build and maintain (Sources needed).

We are here to show exactly how expensive and dangerous they are using Phoenix's open data.

## Traffic Signals Are Expensive to Maintain. 
Phoenix's traffic signals used over 5.2 million kilowatt-hours in 2020 (Phoenix Open Data). It's difficult to get a sense of scale with numbers so large and with units so abstract, so we'll attempt to show you just how excessive the energy usage of traffic signals is.


According to the US Energy Information Administration, the average household in the western United States, where Arizona is located, uses 10,330 kWh a year.
